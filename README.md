> I found it in Codeigniter forum and just make few changes. now you can add it in your project using sparks.

This file dosn't change anything in CI.
You dosn't need to include|load|autoload or use this file. just put it in your project. Your IDE read this file automatically.
This file tested in Netbeans and ZendStudio and work like a charm.
There is one smaple named Your_lib that tell you how to add your own libraries in this file.
